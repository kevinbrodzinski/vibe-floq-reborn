## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Location System Integration** ✅

1. **Single GPS Watch** ✅
   - Field components use `useFieldLocation()` context
   - No direct GPS access - all coordinated through `GlobalLocationManager`
   - Eliminates GPS conflicts that could affect field performance

2. **Smart Batching** ✅
   - Field presence updates batched through `LocationBus`
   - 30-second tile refresh intervals prevent database overload
   - Circuit breaker protection for high-traffic scenarios

3. **Selective Subscriptions** ✅
   - Field components can use `useReadOnlyLocation()` for render-heavy maps
   - Minimizes re-renders during location updates
   - Optimized for smooth field visualization

### **Real-time Performance** ✅

1. **Presence Broadcasting** ✅
   - Field location context enables enhanced presence sharing
   - Proximity tracking for nearby user detection
   - Geofencing integration for venue-based features

2. **Tile Refresh Strategy** ✅
   - 30-second minimum intervals (93% reduction from 2s)
   - Visibility-based throttling (only when tab active)
   - Error backoff prevents refresh storms
