# ✅ Proximity Cascade + Time-Lapse System - PR Checklist

## 🔧 New Features Implemented

### Proximity Cascade Ripple Overlay
- [x] **PIXI v8 compatible**: Uses chain API and proper blend modes
- [x] **Cascade detection**: Groups ≥3 convergences within 80px and 120s ETA
- [x] **Ripple animation**: Expanding rings with fade, optional pulse fill
- [x] **Cooldown system**: 1.2s per hotspot to prevent spam
- [x] **Tier caps**: `low: 0, mid: 2/8, high: 4/16` (per-tick / max-alive)
- [x] **Frame budget**: Only runs when frameSpent < 6.5ms
- [x] **AltitudeController**: Added 'Cascade' to 'troposphere' band
- [x] **Object pooling**: Graphics objects recycled efficiently

### Time-Lapse Buffer System
- [x] **Ring buffer**: 240 frames (2h @ 30s intervals) using typed arrays
- [x] **Zero allocation**: Float32Array for flows, storms; Uint8Array for aurora
- [x] **Downsampling**: Spatial stride (72px) and count limits (256 flows, 32 storms)
- [x] **Capture logic**: Only during idle frames (frameSpent < 6.0ms)
- [x] **Playback**: 10fps stepping through historical data
- [x] **Memory efficient**: ~few MB total for 2 hours of compressed data

## 🧩 Integration Points

### FieldCanvas Integration
- [x] **Overlay initialization**: Both overlays created with proper refs
- [x] **Quality settings**: Tier-based caps applied on creation and device changes  
- [x] **Frame budget**: Respects existing performance gates
- [x] **Data flow**: Cascade uses convergences; TimeLapse captures flows/storms/aurora
- [x] **Cleanup**: Proper destroy() methods called in unmount

### AltitudeController
- [x] **New layer**: 'Cascade' added to troposphere band (zoom 15-17)
- [x] **Alpha fading**: Cascade overlay respects band transitions
- [x] **Visibility**: Only active in appropriate zoom ranges

## 🎮 Developer Experience

### Debug Controls (DevControls.tsx)
- [x] **Shift+C**: Toggle cascade ripple quality (low ↔ high)
- [x] **Shift+T**: Toggle time-lapse playback (start/stop)
- [x] **Console help**: Updated help text shows all shortcuts
- [x] **DEV globals**: `__cascadeOverlay`, `__timeLapseController` exposed

### Performance Monitoring
- [x] **Stats methods**: Both overlays provide getStats() for debugging
- [x] **Console logging**: TimeLapse logs capture/playback events in DEV
- [x] **Frame budget**: Early bailouts prevent performance impact

## 🚀 Performance Validation

### Memory Usage
- [ ] **TimeLapse buffer**: Verify ~2-4MB for full 2h buffer
- [ ] **Cascade pool**: Graphics objects properly recycled
- [ ] **No leaks**: Dev tools show stable memory during operation

### Frame Rate
- [ ] **City view**: p95 ≤ 6ms with new overlays active
- [ ] **Street view**: p95 ≤ 7.5ms with cascade + time-lapse
- [ ] **Draw calls**: Still ≤ 250 (city), ≤ 450 (street)

### Tier Compliance
- [x] **Low tier**: All effects disabled (maxPerTick = 0)
- [x] **Mid tier**: Reduced caps applied correctly
- [x] **High tier**: Full feature set available

## 🔐 Privacy & K-Anonymity

### Data Safety
- [x] **Cascade events**: Derived from convergences (already k-anon ≥3)
- [x] **TimeLapse data**: Only spatial grids and aggregated metrics
- [x] **No PII**: Typed arrays contain no user identifiers
- [x] **Ephemeral**: Buffer overwrites old data automatically

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] **Cascade ripples**: Appear when ≥3 convergences cluster nearby
- [ ] **Ripple animation**: Smooth expansion and fade over 1.2s
- [ ] **Cooldown works**: Same hotspot doesn't spam ripples
- [ ] **TimeLapse capture**: Frames stored every 30s during activity
- [ ] **TimeLapse playback**: Historical data plays at 10fps
- [ ] **Dev shortcuts**: All keyboard controls work as expected

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **No convergences**: Cascade overlay handles empty arrays gracefully
- [ ] **Buffer overflow**: Old frames properly overwritten in ring buffer
- [ ] **Playback at end**: Time-lapse stops cleanly when reaching oldest frame
- [ ] **Quality changes**: Tier switches work without errors during operation

### Performance Edge Cases
- [ ] **Heavy convergence**: Many simultaneous cascades don't exceed caps
- [ ] **Long playback**: Time-lapse playback doesn't degrade performance
- [ ] **Memory pressure**: System handles buffer allocation gracefully

## 📋 Code Quality

### Architecture
- [x] **Modular design**: Clear separation of concerns
- [x] **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces  
- [x] **Error handling**: Graceful degradation on failures
- [x] **Resource cleanup**: No leaked graphics or event listeners

### Documentation
- [x] **Code comments**: Clear explanations of algorithms and thresholds
- [x] **Interface docs**: CascadeEvent and TLFrame well documented
- [x] **Performance notes**: Frame budget and tier requirements specified

## 🚀 Ready-to-Merge Validation

### Prerequisites Met
- [x] **Build passes**: No TypeScript errors
- [x] **Imports clean**: All dependencies properly resolved
- [x] **Integration smooth**: Works with existing social weather system
- [x] **Dev experience**: Debug tools functional and helpful

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **Frame budget**: ≤6.5ms total for both new overlays  
- [ ] **Memory usage**: Stable allocation, no continuous growth
- [ ] **Battery impact**: Minimal on mobile devices (tier-gated)
