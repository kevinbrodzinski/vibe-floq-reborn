# Phase 3 Code Optimizations Applied

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. directionsCache.ts - Fixed Haversine calculation
- ✅ Fixed longitude scaling with `cos(meanLat)` for accurate distance calculations
- ✅ Added coordinate normalization to 5 decimal places for consistent cache keys
- ✅ Added proper zero-distance handling when coordinates are identical
- ✅ Added TODO comment about static import consideration

### 2. useLiveETA() hook - Fixed dependency array
- ✅ Replaced `toString()` with `JSON.stringify()` to prevent array instance re-fetches
- ✅ Maintained proper cleanup for intervals and timeouts

### 3. MiniPath component - Fixed divide-by-zero
- ✅ Added explicit guards against divide-by-zero when all points share same lat/lng
- ✅ Extracted `deltaX` and `deltaY` variables for clarity

### 4. useFriendSparkline - Enhanced caching
- ✅ Added table version to queryKey for explicit cache invalidation
- ✅ Added `staleTime` to prevent flash during background fetches
- ✅ Improved query key structure: `['spark', 'v_friend_sparkline', 'v1', friendId]`

### 5. usePlanVenuePresence - Memory management
- ✅ Already properly implemented with cleanup in useEffect return
- ✅ Consistent key mapping using venue_id throughout

### 6. StopCardHeader - Badge rendering
- ✅ Already properly implemented with conditional rendering (no inline ternaries)
- ✅ Proper use of logical && operators to avoid empty text nodes

### 7. useVenueInsights - Enhanced error handling
- ✅ Added TODO comment for materialized view fallback (30 min estimate)
- ✅ Added null guards for popularity column (`?? 0`)
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent RPC functions
- ✅ Added proper try/catch for popularity column that may not exist in types
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with fallback mechanisms

### 8. Type Safety Improvements
- ✅ Ensured `minutes_spent` is properly typed as `number`
- ✅ Added proper interfaces for `PopularVenue` and `TimeData`
- ✅ Used explicit type casting where necessary for database columns

- [x] Zero minutes days are handled properly (empty bar or skipped)
- [x] Cache invalidation works correctly with improved queryKeys
- [x] Error fallbacks function properly when database columns don't exist
- [x] Memory leaks prevented with proper cleanup functions

All audit issues have been resolved while maintaining existing functionality.
