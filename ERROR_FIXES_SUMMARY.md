# Location Architecture Migration - Error Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the build and test errors that were encountered during the location architecture migration and how they were resolved.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Build Error - Multiple Exports with Same Name

**Error Message:**
```
[vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 8 errors: ERROR: Multiple exports with the same name "useLocationCoords", "useMovementContext", "useLocationHealth", "useLocationMetrics"
```

**Root Cause:**
The `/workspace/src/hooks/location/index.ts` file was exporting the same hooks multiple times:
- Once from their individual files (lines 13, 17, 21)
- Again from `useUnifiedLocation.ts` (line 39)

**Fix Applied:**
Removed the duplicate exports from line 39 in `/workspace/src/hooks/location/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (causing duplicates)
export { useUnifiedLocation, useLocationCore, useLocationTracking, useLocationSharing } from './useUnifiedLocation';

// After (fixed)
export { useUnifiedLocation } from './useUnifiedLocation';
```

The individual hooks `useLocationCore`, `useLocationTracking`, and `useLocationSharing` are already exported from their respective files on lines 13, 17, and 21.

### 2. Test Error - Vitest Mock Issues

**Error Messages:**
```
[vitest] No "useLocationStore" export is defined on the "@/lib/store/useLocationStore" mock. Did you forget to return it from "vi.mock"?
Cannot find module '@/lib/store/useLocationStore'
```

**Root Cause:**
1. The `vi.mock` for `useLocationStore` was incomplete - it was only mocking the selector hooks but not the main `useLocationStore` export
2. The mock was missing several required exports like `useMovementContext`, `useLocationHealth`, `useLocationMetrics`
3. Dynamic imports using destructuring in tests were causing issues with the mocked modules

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Enhanced the mock in `/workspace/src/hooks/location/__tests__/useUnifiedLocation.test.ts`:**
```typescript
vi.mock('@/lib/store/useLocationStore', () => ({
  useLocationStore: vi.fn((selector) => { /* ... */ }),
  useLocationCoords: vi.fn(() => ({ lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194, accuracy: 10 })),
  useLocationStatus: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ... */ })),
  useLocationActions: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ... */ })),
  useTrackingState: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ... */ })),
  // Added missing exports:
  useMovementContext: vi.fn(() => null),
  useLocationHealth: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ... */ })),
  useLocationMetrics: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ... */ }))
}));
```

2. **Fixed dynamic import patterns in tests:**
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const { useLocationStatus } = await import('@/lib/store/useLocationStore');
vi.mocked(useLocationStatus).mockReturnValue({ /* ... */ });

// After (fixed)
const locationStore = await import('@/lib/store/useLocationStore');
vi.mocked(locationStore.useLocationStatus).mockReturnValue({ /* ... */ });
```

## Verification

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING
```bash
npm run build
# Successfully completes with no duplicate export errors
```

### Test Status: ✅ PASSING
```bash
npm test -- --run src/hooks/location/__tests__/useUnifiedLocation.test.ts
# ✓ 17 tests passed
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Export Management**: When consolidating exports in index files, be careful not to create duplicate exports from multiple sources
2. **Vitest Mocking**: When mocking modules with multiple exports, ensure all used exports are included in the mock return object
3. **Dynamic Imports in Tests**: Use full module imports rather than destructuring when working with mocked modules to avoid resolution issues

## Migration Status

✅ **Phase 1: Complete Legacy Migration** - COMPLETED
✅ **Phase 2: Documentation & Testing** - COMPLETED  
✅ **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - COMPLETED
✅ **Phase 4: Optimization & Cleanup** - COMPLETED
✅ **Error Fixes** - COMPLETED

The location architecture migration is now fully complete and operational with all build and test errors resolved.
