# Floq AI Recommendation System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive AI-powered recommendation system for Floq that provides real-time, location-based venue recommendations with personalized learning capabilities. The system is designed for precision, scalability, and measurable impact.

## üèó System Architecture

### Core Components Delivered

1. **Vibe-Weighted Scoring Engine** - Contextual recommendations based on user intent
2. **DB-Assisted Deduplication** - Clean venue data with trigram + geo matching
3. **Real-time Sync Pipeline** - Google Places + Foursquare integration with security
4. **LLM Re-ranking** - Optional OpenAI-powered recommendation enhancement
5. **Personalized Learning** - Both batch and online user model training
6. **Admin Interface** - Vibe weight management dashboard

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations
- `supabase/migrations/2025-08-12_rec_vibe_weights_open_hours.sql`

- `supabase/functions/train-user-model/index.ts` - Batch learning from logs
- `supabase/functions/on-interaction/index.ts` - Real-time learning from interactions

### Client Code
- `src/hooks/usePersonalizedVenues.ts` - Updated hooks for new recommendation system
- `src/components/admin/VibeWeightManager.tsx` - Admin interface for vibe management

### Scripts
- `scripts/sync_la_tiles.sh` - Batch venue sync script for LA area

## üöÄ Key Features

### Smart Venue Scoring
- **Vibe-weighted algorithms**: Different weights for distance, rating, popularity, tag match, cuisine match, and price fit based on user intent
- **Open-hours checking**: Real-time filtering for venues that are actually open
- **Popularity-by-hour**: Uses hourly popularity data when available
- **Personalized weights**: Per-user learned preferences that override global defaults

### Data Quality & Deduplication
- **Cross-provider deduplication**: Prevents "Bestia" and "Bestia DTLA" from appearing as separate venues
- **Alias tracking**: Maps multiple provider IDs to single canonical venues
- **Field quality merging**: Keeps the best data from each source (higher rating counts, better photos, etc.)
- **Trigram + geographic matching**: Fast, accurate duplicate detection

### Learning & Adaptation
- **Batch learning**: Nightly training from recommendation logs + interactions
- **Online learning**: Instant weight updates on strong signals (likes, bookmarks, check-ins)
- **Cold-start handling**: Graceful fallbacks to global defaults
- **Taste drift tracking**: Adapts to changing preferences over time

### Security & Observability
- **Secret-gated endpoints**: Server-only access to sync and training functions
- **Comprehensive logging**: Every sync run and dedupe decision recorded
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes before committing to database
- **A/B testing support**: Built-in experiment tracking

## üîß Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Secrets (rotate quarterly)
SYNC_VENUES_SECRET=your-long-random-string
TRAIN_USER_MODEL_SECRET=your-long-random-string

# Provider APIs
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-google-key
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your-foursquare-key

# Optional AI

OPENAI_RERANK_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Optional tuning
ONLINE_LR=0.04

```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Client-side Recommendations
```typescript
// Get personalized venues with optional LLM re-ranking
const { data } = usePersonalizedVenues({
  lat: 34.0522,
  lng: -118.2437,
  vibe: 'hype',
  tags: ['cocktail', 'late-night'],
  radiusM: 3000,
  useLLM: true, // Enable AI re-ranking
  ab: 'llm_v1' // A/B test bucket
});

// Track user interactions for learning
const trackInteraction = useTrackInteraction();
trackInteraction.mutate({
  venueId: 'venue-uuid',
  interactionType: 'bookmark',
  context: { lat, lng, vibe: 'hype', tags: ['cocktail'] }
});
```

### Server-side Operations
```bash
# Sync venues for a location (dry run first)
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/sync-venues" \
  -H "x-sync-secret: $SYNC_VENUES_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lat":34.0522,"lng":-118.2437,"radius_m":3000,"limit":40,"dry_run":true,"density":"urban"}'

# Train user model
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/train-user-model" \
  -H "x-train-secret: $TRAIN_USER_MODEL_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile_id":"user-uuid","lookback_days":60}'

# Batch sync LA area
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
export SYNC_VENUES_SECRET=your-secret
./scripts/sync_la_tiles.sh
```

## üìà Expected Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Higher relevance**: Vibe-weighted scoring + open-hours filtering reduces dead ends
- **Cleaner data**: Deduplication eliminates venue duplicates
- **Real-time context**: "Open now" and "busy now" logic

### Compound Benefits
- **Personalization**: User models improve recommendations over time
- **Taste adaptation**: System learns from every interaction
- **A/B testable**: Built-in experiment framework for optimization

### Measurable KPIs
- **Top-1 CTR**: Click-through rate on first recommendation
- **90-min check-ins**: Venue visits within 90 minutes of recommendation
- **Cold-start time**: Time to first save/check-in for new users
- **Duplicate rate**: Reduction in duplicate venue appearances

## üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Recent sync runs
SELECT id, started_at, status, (params->>'density') as density
FROM public.venue_import_runs 
ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Dedupe decision breakdown
SELECT decision, count(*) 
FROM public.dedupe_decisions 
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '24 hours'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Recommendation coverage
SELECT count(*) FROM public.venues WHERE geom IS NOT NULL;

-- User model health
SELECT 
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE model_weights IS NOT NULL) as users_trained,
  count(*) as users_total
FROM public.user_tastes;
```

### Performance Checks
```bash
# Edge function health
curl -sS $SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/recommend -X POST -d '{}' | jq

# Recommendation smoke test (replace with real user ID)
SELECT * FROM public.get_personalized_recs(
  'user-uuid'::uuid, 34.0522, -118.2437, 3000, 
  now(), 'hype', array['cocktail'], 'America/Los_Angeles', 5, 'smoke_test'
);
```

## üõ° Security & Best Practices

### Access Control
- Sync functions require `x-sync-secret` header (server-only)
- Training functions require `x-train-secret` header (server-only)
- User data protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
- Recommendation logs are user-scoped

### Operational Safety
- Dry-run mode prevents accidental data changes
- All sync decisions logged for audit/rollback
- Graceful fallbacks if AI services fail
- Rate limiting built into sync scripts

### Data Privacy
- User weights stored as opaque JSON
- No PII in recommendation logs
- Interaction tracking respects user consent
- Admin interface shows anonymized data

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Deployment
1. Apply database migrations in order
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy edge functions
4. Run dry-run sync test
5. Enable recommendation system in app

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Vector similarity**: Add pgvector semantic matching
2. **Category mapping**: Move taxonomy rules to database table
3. **Batch processing**: Optimize training for large user bases
4. **Caching**: Add Redis for frequently accessed recommendations
5. **More providers**: Integrate Yelp, TikTok places, etc.

## üìù Summary
