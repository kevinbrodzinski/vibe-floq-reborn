-- STEP 3 â€” Trade winds materialization + refresh functions
-- Fixed version with proper row counting

-- 1) Target table for precomputed winds (readable; writes only via function)
create table if not exists public.trade_winds (
  id          uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  city_id     uuid                        not null,
  hour_bucket int                         not null check (hour_bucket between 0 and 23),
  dow         int                         not null check (dow between 0 and 6),  -- 0=Sun
  path_id     uuid                        not null,
  points      jsonb                       not null,  -- array of {x,y}
  strength    real                        not null check (strength between 0 and 1),
  avg_speed   real                        not null,
  support     real                        not null check (support between 0 and 1),
  updated_at  timestamptz                 not null default now()
);

-- 2) RLS: SELECT for authenticated; writes only via SECURITY DEFINER function
alter table public.trade_winds enable row level security;

drop policy if exists trade_winds_select on public.trade_winds;
create policy trade_winds_select
  on public.trade_winds
  for select
  to authenticated
  using (true);

-- 3) Indexes for lookup by city + time and by strength
create index if not exists idx_trade_winds_lookup
  on public.trade_winds (city_id, hour_bucket, dow, strength desc);

create index if not exists idx_trade_winds_updated_at
  on public.trade_winds (updated_at desc);

-- 4) SECURITY DEFINER function: refresh all winds for a single city
create or replace function public.refresh_trade_winds(
  p_city_id uuid,
  p_k int default 5,
  p_path_limit int default 24
)
returns int
